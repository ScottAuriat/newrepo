## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#### Benthic Biodiversity experiment

These data were obtained from a mesocosm experiment which aimed to examine the effect of benthic polychaete (*Nereis diversicolor*) biomass on sediment nutrient (NH~4~, NO~3~ and PO~3~) release. At the start of the experiment 15 replicate mesocosms were filled with 20 cm^2^ of **homogenised** marine sediment and assigned to one of five polychaete biomass treatments (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 g per mesocosm).
